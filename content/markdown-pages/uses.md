# Gear I Use

Honestly, it's the gear that keeps me going in this code world.

#### Software Development

* Laptop - MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). Broken screen, broken keyboard because an air conditioner at an office leaked all over it once! Still works much better than my modern MBP at work.
* Keyboard -  Filco Majestouch Minila Air Mechanical Bluetooth Keyboard ([the pink one](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a1z0d.6639537.1997196601.30.65f97484tFKhXy&id=527386125426&skuId=3719085839839))
* Text editor - VS code with [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)
* Font - Currently enjoying [Input Mono](https://input.fontbureau.com/). It's free to download and use for coding, FYI.
* Monitor - [Dell U2417H 24"](https://item.jd.com/2316993.html)

#### Music Gear

* [KRK Rokit 5](https://www.amazon.com/KRK-RP5G3-Powered-Studio-Monitor/dp/B00EO7UNXO) - limited edition "silver" run.
* Headphones - for neutral mixing/reference, I use [Beyerdynamic dt 770 pro](https://global.beyerdynamic.com/dt-770-pro.html). For daily beat bumping, [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.com.hk/en/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3).
* Audio Interface - [Apogee Duet](https://apogeedigital.com/products/duet)
* Field Recordings - I have a very handy [Zoom h5](https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/zoom-h5-handy-recorder) for this purpose.
* Digital Audio Workstation - [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/), of course.
* MP3 encoder - I use [pprmnt](http://pprmnt.cc/) to encode wav -> mp3
* [Korg Microkorg XL](https://www.korg.com/hken/products/synthesizers/microkorg_xl_plus/)
* [Roland SP 404sx](https://www.roland.com/global/products/sp-404sx/)
* A smattering of midi controllers in varying states of breakage.
