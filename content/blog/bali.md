At the end of October, I was lucky enough to visit Indonesia for the first time on a company retreat. To me, this is kind of a big deal. We went to the island of Bali, a super popular tourist destination. Feel very privileged to have had this opportunity.

It was technically a "workcation" -- our mornings were filled with intense work, and afternoons were left open for adventures. We didn't have an actual office, so we just kind of hung out in the lobby and various areas of the resort. I did scrum everyday with no shirt on. The temperature was very hot.

Highlight for me: surfing. We went a few times, the best spot was of course Canggu. Awesome waves. On the very last day, I went up to Canggu alone and had a solo surf session before heading back to Shanghai. So awesome.

Hope to go back again for more surfing.
