Nothing to see here, it's just the city I live in. 

Someday I will leave this place. 

When I do leave, there will be a lot of things I will very, very glad to leave behind. But one thing I will definitely miss: Shanghai's morning vibes. Particularly the breakfast. Shanghai's brekfast is amazing. 煎饼, 煎饺, 小笼包, those breakfast noodles. Not to mention, Shanghai actually has a very decent coffee scene. Bad coffee does not survive well in Shanghai, we have high standards in this city. 

I don't know if I'm ready to leave all those things behind yet. Especially the 煎饼.
