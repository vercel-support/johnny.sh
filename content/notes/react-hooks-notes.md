# React Hooks
Notes and resources for react hooks patterns.

## Resources
* [use hooks](https://usehooks.com/) - collection of React hooks
* [official API reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)
* [simple example](https://codesandbox.io/s/eager-hertz-bugcv) of global state management/redux pattern.
* [async actions](https://www.sitepoint.com/replace-redux-react-hooks-context-api/) - how to replace redux with react hooks + context, including some async/data fetching examples.

## Libs

#### Constate
A simple lib that exports one function called `createUseContext`, which allows using local state or global state interchangeably with a hook. Push local state to global context.

#### React Combine Provider
Name is pretty self explanatory -- combine providers. Wouldn't actually use this lib, but can reference the single file in the lib, a reduce function which combines providers.
