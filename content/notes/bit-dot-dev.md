## bit.dev

Uhhh. Just putting this here for future reference: [bit.dev](https://bit.dev/)

It's like a component package solution, for sharing components between projects. Maybe less relevant now that github and your mom are doing monorepos, but, it's still cool.


Weirdest part: I just remembered I have an account on this site, and I found out about my account by googling my own name :0
