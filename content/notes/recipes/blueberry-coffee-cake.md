WIP

### Ingredients

* Nonstick Cooking Spray (as needed)
* 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter (softened, for cake)(4oz)
* 1 cup Granulated Sugar (for cake)
* 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract
* 2 Large Egg
* 1 cup Sour Cream
* 2 cups Cake Flour (or all-purpose flour, for cake)
* 1 teaspoon Baking Powder
* 1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1/2 teaspoon Salt (for cake)
* 1 cup Fresh Blueberries
* 1 cup All-Purpose Flour (for crumble topping)
* 1/2 cup Light Brown Sugar (packed, for crumble)
* 2 tablespoons Granulated Sugar (for crumble)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons Ground Cinnamon (for crumble)
* 1/8 teaspoon Salt (for crumble)
* 1/3 cup Unsalted Butter (melted, for crumble)

#### Prepare the Pan

You need a 9 inch pan. Butter it, or prepare it using non-stick cooking spray.

#### Cream The Sugary Stuff

Place the butter, sugar, and vanilla in a large mixing bowl. Use a hand mixer to cream the ingredients together on medium-high speed until smooth, 1-2 minutes. Add the eggs and sour cream, and continue beating for 1 minute, until the mixture is light and fluffy.

* 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter (softened, for cake) (4oz)
* 1 cup Granulated Sugar (for cake)
* 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract
* 2 Large Egg
* 1 cup Sour Cream

#### Move on to Doughland

Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into the bowl. Mix on low speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed, until a smooth, thick batter forms. Fold in the blueberries.

* 2 cups Cake Flour (or all-purpose flour, for cake)
* 1 teaspoon Baking Powder
* 1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1/2 teaspoon Salt (for cake)
* 1 cup Fresh Blueberries

#### Move the dough into the pan

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth it into an even layer.

#### Prepare the crumble

Place the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir with a fork to combine. Drizzle the melted butter over the flour mixture, and mix with the fork until the mixture forms large crumbs. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the cake batter.

* 1 cup All-Purpose Flour (for crumble topping)
* 1/2 cup Light Brown Sugar (packed, for crumble)
* 2 tablespoons Granulated Sugar (for crumble)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons Ground Cinnamon (for crumble)
* 1/8 teaspoon Salt (for crumble)
* 1/3 cup Unsalted Butter (melted, for crumble) (1.5 oz)


#### Cook It

The oven should be pre-heated to 350 degrees fahrenheit, that's 176.67 degrees celsius.

Bake the coffee cake on the middle rack of the oven until the topping is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35-45 minutes.
