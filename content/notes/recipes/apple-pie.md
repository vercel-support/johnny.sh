# APPLE PIE

Stolen, from elsewhere. Havent' tried this yet.

### Ingredients

* 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie (see [my pie crust interpretation](./pie-crust))
* 0.5 cup unsalted butter
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 0.25 cup water
* 0.5 cup white sugar
* 0.5 cup packed brown sugar
* 8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced


### Step 1
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.

### Step 2
Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.

### Step 3
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
