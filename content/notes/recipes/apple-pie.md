# APPLE PIE

Stolen, from elsewhere. Havent' tried this yet.

### Ingredients

* 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie (see [my pie crust interpretation](./pie-crust))
* 0.5 cup unsalted butter
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 0.25 cup water
* 0.5 cup white sugar
* 0.5 cup packed brown sugar
* 8 Granny Smith apples
* 1.5 tsp cinnamon


### Step 1
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Whisk in the flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. 

### Step 2
Peel, remove cores and thinly slice 7 cups of apples and place them in a large bowl. Sprinkle the top with 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and toss to combine. Pour the sauce over the apples and stir to coat the apple slices.

### Step 3
Sprinkle your work surface with flour and roll out bottom pie crust to a 12" diameter circle. Wrap it around your rolling pin to transfer it to the 9" pie plate. 

### Step 4
Add apple mixture, mounding slightly in the center and being careful not to get the filling on the edges which would make it difficult to seal.

### Step 5
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
