### Coffee Knowledege
* There are two types of coffee - robusta and arabica
* Robusta is used for espresso and instant coffee, it's bitter and strong
* Arabica is the smooth goodness we know and love

Coffee(and particularly arabica) is a very picky plant - it grows in a very specific climate. It should be between 18 and 21 degrees celsius. It needs a specific amount of rain, and is best if it has a 3 month dry season so that it can flower. Crucially, it needs hot days and cold nights - that's why it's most commonly grown at a specific elevation, 1000-2000 meters above sea level.
