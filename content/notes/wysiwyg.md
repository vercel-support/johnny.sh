# Wysiwyg Editors

Non-exhaustive list of rich text editors/wysiywyg editors.

### consider using
* [Draft JS](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js) - solid rich text editor from facebook open source, for react. [link](https://draftjs.org/), [in action](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-plugin-content-manager/admin/src/components/Wysiwyg/index.js)
* [ReactMDE](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde) - react markdown editor built on draft js - seems legit-ish
* [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor) - markdown/wysiwyg hybrid. Still shows markdown, but designed for non-technical users who are not familiar with or learning markdown - [preview](https://simplemde.com/)
* [Toast UI Editor](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor) - pretty full featured, but not very extensible and actually very big bundle
* [medium editor](http://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/)
* [ck editor](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5)
* [react-markdown-editor-lite](https://github.com/HarryChen0506/react-markdown-editor-lite) - idk, maybe good?
* [React-Editor](https://github.com/fritx/react-editor)
* [react-draft-wysiwyg](https://github.com/jpuri/react-draft-wysiwyg)
* [Material UI Rich Text Editor](https://github.com/niuware/mui-rte)
* [Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/) - "Block Editor"
* [Quill](https://quilljs.com/)




### Less impressive
* Prosemirror - simple. [link](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror)
* Trix - seems good but based on coffeescript so i don't like. [link](https://github.com/basecamp/trix)
* pandao editor.md. kind of outdated, seems bloated. [link](https://github.com/pandao/editor.md)
* [Tiny MCE](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce)
