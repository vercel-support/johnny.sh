# Wysiwyg Editors

## consider using
* DraftJS - solid rich text editor from facebook open source, for react. 
	* [link](https://draftjs.org/)
	* [github](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js)
	* [in action](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-plugin-content-manager/admin/src/components/Wysiwyg/index.js)
* ReactMDE - react markdown editor built on draft js - seems legit-ish. [link](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde)
* SimpleMDE - markdown/wysiwyg hybrid. Still shows markdown, but designed for non-technical users who are not familiar with or learning markdown. [link](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor), [preview](https://simplemde.com/)
* TUI-editor - pretty full featured, not very extensible and actually big bundle [link](https://nhnent.github.io/tui.editor/api/latest/tutorial-example01-basic.html)
* [editorJS](https://gist.github.com/astoilkov/013c513e33fe95fa8846348038d8fe42) - block-based editor
* [medium editor](http://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/)



### Less impressive
* Prosemirror - simple. [link](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror)
* Trix - seems good but based on coffeescript so i don't like. [link](https://github.com/basecamp/trix)
* pandao editor.md. kind of outdated, seems bloated. [link](https://github.com/pandao/editor.md)
