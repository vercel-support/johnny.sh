# Desktop Apps

While I haven't ever shipped a desktop app to production, I've been fiddling with the different options and tech for building cross-platform desktop apps. [Electron](electronjs.org) is huge in the Node JS and frontend world, so I try to follow the latest in this space.


* [Electron](electronjs.org) - the incumbent "best practice"
* [Deskgap](https://github.com/patr0nus/DeskGap) - like electron, but uses native system browser
* [Electrino](https://github.com/pojala/electrino)
* [Quark](https://github.com/jscherer92/Quark)
* [Appify](https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/674099) - Super simple way to wrap an executable in a macOS desktop app.
* [Similar script as application approach](https://github.com/thedzy/run-your-script-as-an-application) - kind of sketchy.
* [graffiti](https://github.com/cztomsik/graffiti)
* [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/)
* [revery](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) - not necessarily using frontend tech/Javascript, but is designed to be easy for JS devs to use. Super performant next-gen shit.
* [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/)
* [sciter](https://sciter.com/) - no idea how it works, but is extremely lightweight when compared with electron. [example app](https://github.com/GirkovArpa/clipper-sciter)
