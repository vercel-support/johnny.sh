* react testing library  https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library
* Recharts [GitHub - recharts/recharts: Redefined chart library built with React and D3](https://github.com/recharts/recharts)
* Formik [GitHub - jaredpalmer/formik: Build forms in React, without the tears 😭](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik)
* [Formal](https://github.com/iamkevinwolf/formal/tree/master/packages/formal-web) - like formik but w/ hooks
* Styled media query [GitHub - morajabi/styled-media-query: 💅💍  Better media queries for styled-component](https://github.com/morajabi/styled-media-query)
* [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) - really cool hook-based lib for fetching + caching.
