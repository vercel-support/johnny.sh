# Learning C Programming

I decided to learn this language because: 
* It's cool.
* For Web Assembly apps.
* I feel like I'm missing some context for some CS fundamentals.

These are my notes from reading [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).
