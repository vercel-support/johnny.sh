# Homebrew Packages

A list of cool homebrew packages (mostly command line tools) I have installed

* __htop__ -> monitor process & cpu usage
* __nmap__ -> network mapping, scan ports, hosts, etc.
* __watch__ -> not really sure what this does but i installed it.
* __nvim__ -> the next generation of vim. has insane diffing capabilities. need to learn how to use it better.
* __fortune__ -> gives you a weird fortune.
