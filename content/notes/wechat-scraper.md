> WeChat Official Account Analytics


### Brief
__Task__: Create a web app that scrapes, saves, and serves analytics about WeChat official accounts. Mainly going after `likes`, `reads`, `comments`, `time`.
A task indeed. This should eventually be able to be abstracted out into a SAAS that can accomplish this for paid subscribers, funnelling them eventually towards WCL Omni channel services.

__Immediate Plan__: Make a lightweight, maintable, production ready web app that can do this on a basic level.
