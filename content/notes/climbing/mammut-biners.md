# Mammut Biners

Trying to figure out why they are different.

![Mammut Biners Front](../../images/mammut_front.jpg)
![Mammut Biners Back](../../images/mammut_back.jpg)

Notice on the front, they are identical, on the back the one on the right has the "Mammut" text logo, the one on the left does not.

These were bought at the same store a few months apart.

Update: Mammut confirmed authenticity of both biners.
> We have traced the batches and we can confirm that they are both Mammut carabiners. They were produced in different years and we added the Mammut logo at a later point in time. The carabiners are safe to use.
