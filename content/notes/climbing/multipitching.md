# Multipitching

Most of the sport climbing I've done thus far is single pitch. Learning to climb multipitch is the first step towards "big wall" climbing. These are some random notes.


### Gear Needed

Other than the usual climbing gear needed (harness, etc.) there are a few additional pieces needed.

* 2 slings - 1 for personal safety anchor, 1 for the belay anchor/master point. The second one (belay anchor) will also be used for the rappel extension.
* 2 additional locking carabiners - for the belay anchor/master point.
* ATC - a traditional ATC belay device is needed for rappeling, cannot use Grigri for rappel.
* Prusik cord - needed for rapelling, [prusik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusik) is a third hand.
* Helmet - negligibly optional (while climbing) for sport climbing, but is a **must have** for multipitch.
* Somewhere to put cell phone
